  <p>After over five years working as a  biomedical lab technician, I realized that path didn’t reflect who I truly am. I’ve always been deeply curious about people; understanding their behaviors, needs, and emotions comes naturally to me.</p>
  <p>That’s why discovering UX felt like more than a shift: it felt like a homecoming.</p>
  <p>The idea of researching with users, anticipating their needs, and solving real problems through design was a revelation. And when it comes to UI, my love for precision and doing things the right way fits perfectly.</p>
  <p>I approach life and work with positivity, diligence and consistency, values that have always paid off. emplicity is so beautiful, that is why is so complicated.</p>
